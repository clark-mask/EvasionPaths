# Evasion Paths

This repository implements the algorithm described in _[Evasion paths in mobile sensor networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.3536.pdf)_, along with several numerical experiments pertaining to the persistance of evaision paths.

# System Requirements
This repo uses python modules that are easiest to install using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)

# Clone Repository
To download this repository, use the following 

`git clone https://KyleWill@bitbucket.org/KyleWill/evasion-paths.git`

# Configuration 
The `enviroment.yml` file specifies the exact python enviroment used to ensure consistant resutls. 

To configure the enviroment, use command

`conda env create --file enviroment.yml --name gudhi --force`

Then the enviroment can be activated/deactivated using:

`conda activate gudhi`
and
`conda deactivate gudhi`
