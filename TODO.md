# Features:
 - Collective Motion Model
 
# Bugs:
 - Points are not reflected during interpolation
 
 # Documentation:
 - Write MainPage
    
 - Measure Complexity and benchmark algorithm
 
# Structural:
 - Examples
    - Sample Animation
    - Simple run
    - Run in parallel
    - Putting max time on simulation
    - example run.sh
 - Add unit tests
 - giv boundary and motion model consistent interface.
 # Experiments
 - Write script to plot N-R data
 
 # Future Development:
 - Allow for fully disconnected graph ("power on")
 - Compute alpha complex fully in parallel
 - AlphaComplex with variable radii
 - Decaying sensing
 - Work towards fully distributed algorithm
 - 3D?
 - "Smart" Motion Model
