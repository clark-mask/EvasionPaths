# Features:
 - Collective Motion Model
 
# Bugs:
 - Points are not reflected during interpolation
 
 # Documentation:
 - Write MainPage
    
# Structural:
 - Examples
    - Make sure they all work
    - Comment
    - Clean up
 - Add unit tests
 - giv boundary and motion model consistent interface.
 
 # Experiments
 - N = 20, R = 0.18, RunAndTumble
 - More refined N/R sweep
 
 # Future Development:
 - Allow for fully disconnected graph ("power on")
 - Compute alpha complex fully in parallel
 - AlphaComplex with variable radii
 - Decaying sensing
 - Work towards fully distributed algorithm
 - 3D?
 - "Smart" Motion Model
 - Measure Complexity and benchmark algorithm
