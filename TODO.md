# Features:
 - Collective Motion Model
 
# Bugs:
 - Fix environment.yml to be portable
 - Points are not reflected during interpolation
 
 # Documentation:
 - Finish writing documentation
 - Go through and comment files
 - DOxygen?
 - Measure Complexity and benchmark algorithm
 
# Structural:
 - Simplify/Update/Add example scripts
 - Remove experiments from git tracking
 - Add unit tests
 
 # Experiments
 - N - slice
 - R - slice
 - N-R sample
 
 # Future Development:
 - Allow for fully disconnected graph ("power on")
 - Compute alpha complex fully in parallel
 - AlphaComplex with variable radii
 - Work towards fully distributed algorithm
 - 3D?
 - "Smart" Motion Model
